# Project Kanban

## Content
An application made with MERN Starter. Uses local install of MongoDB.
Needs some cleaning up.

## Todo
* Major cleanup: remove code and tests for posts from starter
* Write better layout and styling: header, footer, color scheme
* remove notes' ids from lanes' array (this one is annoying - notes are removed from app but stay partially in database)
* split Kanban component to presentational (button and note) and container (store operations and add note feature)
* add server side data saving after dropping a note at a new place
* use external MongoDB server and send project to Github Pages
